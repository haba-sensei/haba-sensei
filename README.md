## 👋 Hello! 
Software engineer with 6+ years of experience.  Worked for innovative startups, large enterprise products, and award-winning agencies.  Familiar with both remote, and in-office roles.  Always seeking to take ownership of the project and deliver faster than expected.  Comfortable for web, mobile, and API development.

## 📚 Writing
Besides developing, I also write on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/haba-sensei) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@_aerdeljac)

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
It wouldn't make sense to post every tool and language I've ever worked with, but here are some I am most comfortable with at the moment.
